### Instruction to read the data
For this experiment, we use the energy price dataset used in the paper ["Smart Predict-and-Optimize for Hard Combinatorial Optimization Problems"](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v34i02.5521). 
We write the script `get_energy.py` to read the data from `prices2013.dat`. The deatils of the scheduling problem is inside the folder `EnergyCost`.

### Reproducing the results
In order to reproduce the result, run the files, whose name start with `test` and use the hyperparameter as stated in **Appendix B**.
